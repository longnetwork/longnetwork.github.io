###### If you have a Google account, then you have a free runtime environment that can replace a dedicated server in some cases.

Installing web applications in Google Apps Acript is not much more difficult than installing games;)

Everyone can set up a wallet in their personal Google account and interact with it individually and privately.
You can accept/transfer **LONG** coins, as well as burn coins and receive signatures in return for minting **wLONG** tokens.
