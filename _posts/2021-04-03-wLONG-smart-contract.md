###### wLONG issuance is created distributed by users of the native LONG coin blockchain, by irrevocably burning LONG. 

**wLONG** provides mechanisms to exchange BNB and other tokens via the **uniswap** protocol, as well as 
to profit from creating liquidity on decentralized exchanges and now wLONG is available in token wallets
